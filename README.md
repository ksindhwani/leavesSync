# LeavesSync
This project helps to create a google calender event as soon as the leave of the employee gets approved from the system. This projects uses Google Apps Script to scan the email and create calender event. The project is currently focus to sync leaves which are created through **Oracle HRIS** system only.

## Setup

This script is created through Google Apps script. Currently the project is script based, so user has to move script from repo to google suite. Following are steps needed to setup this project.
#### The script is scanning Leave approval mails received in the Gmail inbox after the present day 12 AM, therefore it won't create any calender event if there is no approval mails after the current day 12 AM.


* Open Google Drive and sign in that with your gmail account. The gmail account used should be same as the one where user gets their leave approve emails.
* Click on New -> More -> Google Apps Script. 


**Please make sure the gmail account in your Apps Suite Project should be same as what you used to sign in your drive. Sometimes google uses the default email id for Google Apps Project.**

## POINTS TO REMEMBER

* This script only handles the Annual Leave and Compensatory Leave as of now.
* The script takes every Leave request as a seperate event. It won't merge them. This is to make the implementation relatively simple.
* If No Calender Name is defined, the leave Event will be created in Default Calendar.
* Mentioning **Your Display Name** is mandatory.

## Setting Triggers

The above mentioned steps allows you to run the script manually, but you can also configure the script as a schedule job so that it will run automatically. It is recommended to set the execution once in a day during the end hours in order to allow script to scan all the Approval mails recieved during that day.

Please follow the the steps to setup automatic triggers. The above successful execution already created an event for you. Make sure either to clean that event from Calendar to avoid duplicate events from automatic trigger or set the trigger for next day execution.
* Click on **Triggers** from left Sidebar

## Future Action Items (Its never done)
* Handle some edge cases like 
  * Handle duplicated Events in Calandar
  * Merging the continuous leaves events into one event.
  * Bugs fixing.

* Turn this into a web app or a chrome extension so that all the setup steps mentioned above can be reduced to merly simple configurations.
